	Put your custom display types here, for example, if we wanted a display type called months display we would do the following:
	<div ng-switch-when="months" class="spoke-element spoke-display"><p>{{property.value}} months</p></div>
	
	and in our property definition (in the Model) we would write property(spokeType="months");
	
	Do check through the current inputss in input switch for examples.
